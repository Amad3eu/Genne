# Coding Style

## File Layout (`src/components/*.js`)

1. Imports
2. Reusable components needed for the main component
3. Main component (Eg: Addons in addons.js)
4. export default \<MainComponent\>;

## Reusable components

- Do not make a new file for smaller components.
- Smaller, reusable components needed in the main components should be added **above** the main component, **not** inside it.
- Use ES6 arrow functions for defining components.

## Spacing

1. **JS:**
   - Use a space after `if`, `for`, `while`, `switch`.
   - Do not use a space after the opening `(` and before the closing `)`.
   - Use a space before and after destructuring objects.
   ```js
   //good
   const { apple, mangoes } = fruits;

   //bad
   const { apple, mangoes } = fruits;
   ```


        //Same for destructuring props:
        //good
        const BeautifulComponent = ({ prop1, prop2 }) => {}

        //bad
        const UglyComponent = ({prop1, prop2}) => {}
    ```

2. **JSX:**

   - Use a space before the forward slash (`/`) of a self-closing tag

   ```js
   //good
   <Foo />

   //bad
   <Foo/>
   ```

   - Do **not** use spaces for JSX curly braces

   ```js
   //good
   <Foo bar={baz} />

   //bad
   <Foo bar={ baz } />
   ```

## **Props:**

- Use camelCase for prop names, or PascalCase if the prop value is a React component.
- Use new lines when props do not fit on the same line.

  ```js
  //good
  <Foo
      prop1={value1}
      prop2={value2}
      prop3={value3}
  />

  //bad
  <Foo prop1={value1} prop2={value2} prop3={value3} />
  ```

## **Best practices:**

- **Always** add semicolons after a line.
- Use ES6 arrow functions.
- Keep the indentation in your code correct.
- Use 4 spaces for tabs.
- Don't Repeat Yourself. If you think you're repeating too much code, make a smaller component, or a function.
- **Always** add alt prop to `img` tags.
- Add `rel="noopener"` for `a` tags which has `target="_blank"`.
- Don't do `outline: none` on user input elements. If you do not want outline, give them faint, visible background on focus. This is for accessibility.

### Other things to note

- We are using [octicons](https://primer.style/octicons/) for icons. Use this if you need to add icons. Do **not** add a new library for icons.
- Try to not commit changes in `package.json`, `package-lock.json`.
- Discuss with contributors on discord if you're planning to add/remove a package.
